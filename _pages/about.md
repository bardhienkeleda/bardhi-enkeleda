Enkeleda Bardhi is a Cybersecurity PostDoc at DIAG, Sapienza University of Rome, working with [Prof. Silvia Bonomi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=it&hl=it&user=s-szb04AAAAJ&sortby=pubdate) and [Prof. Riccardo Lazzeretti](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mBq2JNsAAAAJ&hl=it&oi=ao), while being a collaborator of [SPRITZ Research Group](https://spritz.math.unipd.it/) at University of Padua. She obtained the Ph.D. degree in Computer Science Engineering on May 2024, from Sapienza University of Rome. During her Ph.D., from August to November 2023, she was with [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/) at the [PurNet group](https://gitlab.com/purnet-lab/purnet-lab.gitlab.io/-/wikis/home) hosted by [Prof. Muhammad Shahbaz](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=it&user=UhWjpNMAAAAJ). Additionally, from October 2022 to February 2023, she was with [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/) at the [Networked and Embedded Systems Group](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/software-technology/networked-systems) hosted by [Prof. Fernando Kuipers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W9BWce4AAAAJ&hl=it&oi=ao).
Her main research interest include the Network Security and Privacy, with a particular focus on the emerging and future network architectures -- i.e., Named-Data Networking (NDN) -- and Programmable Networks. Furthermore, she is particularly interested into applying Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques for both the attacking and defence point of view. Lastly, she is also interested into the security and privacy of the ML.
